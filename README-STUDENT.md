<h2>About</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?

My project is a fully animated skeleton for a modded character in the game rivals of aether. I built it because I like the game and I wanted to work on something game development related since I am interested in that field.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
 Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.

 My goal was to have a fully working character but that soon became unrealistic and so I had to convert to just having working sprites but not working hitboxes and hurtboxes.
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>My goal is to have a working character model that is centered on the floor and can load properly</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
So... what did you learn? (start this, but **come back to it at the end of the sprint**)

I learned that before I start a project I should be aware of how files may interact with a game and instead of trying to cut corners, make the files exactly as the game wantss so it doesn't bug out.

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
How would I, or anyone who comes across this project, run this project? Make sure to include all the steps.

So unfortunately to be able to run the game you do have to buy it off of steam but once you have the game downloaded if I send you the files you place it in the workshop folder and the character will run. If I end up completing the character I will upload it onto the workshop forums on steam so that anyone can download it much easier.

<h2>Misc.</h2>
Feel free to add anything else you want here :)

It made me quite mad to find out that my pixel editor was making every file 10x larger which caused about 90% of my problems.
